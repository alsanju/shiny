This is the source code for a puromycin explorer app which runs on R and Shiny. 

Puromycin is a dataset in R, and contain data about the reaction velocity versus substrate concentration in an enzymatic reaction involving untreated cells or cells treated with Puromycin.


This app allows you to perform a specific filtering of your data depending of the different variables. 
In addition, you can obtain a ggplot that include ***your filtered data from your data table**.

To run it locally you'll need to install the latest versions of ![Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and ![ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/).
