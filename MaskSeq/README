This is the source code for a masking sequence app which runs on R and Shiny.

This app has been performed to make easier the oligo design, and allows the user to mask with 'N' different positions in a specific sequence that have a Minor Allele Frequency higer than a scpecific value.
This sequence can be the exon sequences of a gene or a specific variation. The 5'UTR, 3'UTR and intronic flanking regions are specified by the user.

To run it locally you'll need to install the latest versions of Shiny and RSQLite packages.
Also you need the reference genome and your sqlite database.

The data is automaticatly saved in the output directory.

This applet is pending to be published in http://alba-sanchis-juan.shinyapps.io
