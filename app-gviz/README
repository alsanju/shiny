This is the source code for a Gviz app (a bioconductor package) which runs on R and Shiny.

This app allows you to get the information for one gene through Biomart using R, and download your data in a txt file. You can filter your information by the gene name or the Ensembl ID, depending the assembly GRCh37 or GRCh38.
In a different tab is shown the gene location and the transcripts representation for this gene. 

To run it locally you'll need to install the latest versions of Shiny, Gviz and biomaRt.

The applet was made as a part of my final master project.
